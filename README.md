# MapIt

MapIt is a fully functioning Android app developed using [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) and inspired by the [Map It: Displaying Locations on a Google Map](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/displaying-maps) tutorial.

The code in the `.aia` file in this repository can be examined in detail by first cloning this repository then selecting the Projects > Import project (.aia) from my computer... menu item in the [MIT App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu) web tool.

MapIt.aia is the base MapIt code developed following the tutorial linked above, with the bug fix to the ListPicker display. MapIt_MVC.aia is the refactored code with Model, View and Controller components clearly separated (as much as is possible with App Inventor).
